Changed made in the last modification :
1. Added the main function and put the entire source code inside it.
2. Added the conditional statements for the proper calling of the main function + error handling too at that point of the script execution.
3. Also the error catching code by which now the user has the option to exit the script anytime by pressing the CTRL+C key combination.
